Intelligent Water Conservation system is an innovative system where it will detect the 
water level through Ultrasonic sensors and verifies the threshold value (comparing it with the containerâ€™s 
depth) that is set i.e. ( e.g >20 cm). If the value is less than the threshold value, no action needs to be 
taken and if the value is beyond the threshold value, the Arduino UNO alerts the user through a message 
by using the GSM module and stops the pump through the breaker circuit, along by the buzzer produces 
a beep sound when the set limit of the liquid is crossed.

A UI is used to display the status of the level of liquid in the containers. The liquid level is highlighted as 
colored to show the level of liquid present in the container with the help of the application. Now when the 
water level drops below a particular threshold (low-level point), the proposed system pumps the water 
from the source like a well or river through a submersible water pump until a high-level point threshold of 
water fills the tank.

Moisture sensors are used to detect the moisture level in the soil of the field and if its below certain 
threshold value then a signal must be sent to the tank where with the help of some servo motor water 
flows out of the tank into the fields.

The tank is also provided with a lid which is actuated by servo motors when the rainfall is detected 
as a result of obtaining a stance in rainwater harvesting.
Thus this system helps to prevent the wastage of water and helps us to save it.
